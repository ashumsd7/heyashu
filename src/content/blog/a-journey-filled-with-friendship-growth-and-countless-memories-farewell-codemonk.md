Hello Everyone,

This is Ashutosh, and today marks the last day of my journey at Codemonk—at least in this home. But this is just a transition, not a farewell forever. We will always be connected through different platforms, and our bond will remain strong.

More than 1000 days at Codemonk—it’s impossible to sum up in just a few words. I have lived countless emotions, traveled to amazing places, worked on 10+ projects, and with the support of my founders and team, I have been able to support my family as well. This journey has been nothing short of incredible.

I still remember when I joined. We were just 4-5 people in the office—me, Akshay, the chai partner for evening tea runs; Suhas, my badminton/marathon/trip partner; and Ashwin, who was always there for anything I needed. Whether it was cycling, coding discussions, marathons, or even badminton, Ashwin was our own Hanuman, always lifting us up. He took us to some of the most beautiful places like Madikeri and Coorg, and for that, he holds a special place in my heart.

But this isn’t a final goodbye—because family doesn’t say goodbye, they just relocate. Codemonk has been my family, and I have seen it grow from just 10 members to nearly 100+ today. It all started with Mukkadir and Harshita, our Northeast adventurers, and then our beloved all-rounders Karna and Nihal joined. But something was missing—the heart of India. Then came Kavish, the champion of all; Harshil, whose wisdom is unmatched; Ram Shankar, the man of transformations; and Atul, the humble chai premi—becoming the pillars of Codemonk, bringing strength from all parts of the country.

And of course, what’s a journey without some Lady Gaga energy? Enter Shravani! 🎉 A big round of applause for her! Alongside her, Sayali, our amazing manager, joined in, making this team feel even more like a family.

Even though I have been working from home for the past two years, I never once felt far from you all. You stood by me in every challenge, celebrated every success, and made work feel like home.

A special thank you to our founders—for always supporting us, trusting us, and allowing us flexibility, especially during tough times.

To my wonderful teammates—Chandrika, Ravi, Sparsh, and Maulik—working on projects with you was like working with friends, not colleagues.

As time passed, new faces joined, adding their magic to the team—Lokesh Suresh and Rudra, the talented duo and genius; Ritika, the shining friend.

Thanks to my managers, Ajay and Anirban.

I am also grateful to Aslam, Mukhlan, Lokesh, Vishnu, Lavanya, and Rahil for being a part of this amazing experience.

This is not goodbye. I’m just a call away. I will be meeting you all in Bengaluru soon, and I know you will all keep growing and shining in your careers.

I wish you all good health, happiness, and success in everything you do.
This is Ashutosh, signing off—with a simple video of our memories together.\
