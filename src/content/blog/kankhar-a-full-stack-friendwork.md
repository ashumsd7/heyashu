# KANKHAR: A Full Stack Friendwork (of Friendship)



In the silicon jungle of Bengaluru, where code monkeys swing from tree to tree, a legend was born. Not just any legend, mind you, but a full-stack legend - KANKHAR! üêíüíª

It all began in the aftermath of the great plague (aka COVID), when a brave soul ventured into the urban wilderness of Bengaluru. His name? **Ashutosh Anand Tiwari.**

In November 2021, Ashutosh planted his flag at CodeMonk, becoming the first to join this fledgling banana republic of developers. Little did he know, he was about to become the nucleus of something far greater than himself.

As the calendar flipped to April 2022, Ashutosh found himself face-to-face with two "interns." But calling Nihal and Karan mere interns would be like calling a smartphone a fancy calculator.

These code-slingin' savants turned CodeMonk upside down faster than you can say "runtime error." The trio formed a bond stronger than any merge conflict, fueled by endless plates of lemon rice and idly. But as any good developer knows, variety is the spice of life (and the bane of legacy code).

Enter the Litti Chokha Crusader, Ram Shankar!

With his arrival, the team's flavor profile expanded faster than an unoptimized for-loop. But something was still missing in this masala mix of talent.

Lo and behold, from the land of dhokla and garba, came the backend behemoth - Harshil!

Now they had it all - North, South, and Gujarat. A pan-Indian papad of programming prowess! But wait, what's that sound? It's the honking of a Delhi metro, bringing with it the final piece of the puzzle.

Make way for Kavish, the dropout who could out-code a senior dev with one hand tied behind his back!

The team was buzzing with energy, like a server farm on Red Bull. They thought they were complete, a full stack of talent reaching from frontend to backend. But oh, how wrong they were!

For in the heart of India, Madhya Pradesh, a crucial element was waiting to join the mix. Enter Atul, the nucleus that would bind this atom of awesomeness together!

And thus, KANKHAR was born - a full stack framework of friendship, talent, and enough inside jokes to fill a terabyte hard drive.

Through thick and thin, from marathon coding sessions to food comas induced by excessive litti chokha consumption, KANKHAR stood strong. Some moved to work from home, others chased bigger paychecks (we're looking at you, litti chokha deserters!), but the bond remained unbroken.

Now, as December approaches and wedding bells ring for Harshil in Gujarat, the KANKHAR framework prepares for a joyous reunion. It's proof that no matter the distance, no matter the job changes, no matter how many times you have to explain to your relatives what a "full stack developer" actually does, KANKHAR endures.

So here's to KANKHAR - may your code be bug-free, your deployments smooth, and your friendships eternal. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a train to catch at 4... and it's already 3:45! Time flies when you're compiling heartwarming stories about coding companions.

Catch you on the flip side, from the land of garba and git pushes! üöÇüí®
