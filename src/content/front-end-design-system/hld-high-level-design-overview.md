High-Level Design (HLD) for a frontend application is **an overview of the application's architecture and structure**. It focuses on the big picture without detailing the implementation of each component.

HLD is a phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the overall architecture and structure of a software system or application are planned and documented. It bridges the gap between requirement specifications and actual implementation. The goal is to provide a blueprint or roadmap for how the system will function and how its various components will interact.

From requirement gathering to understanding users, architecture design, development, and deliveryâ€”everything is planned in HLD to ensure a smooth process without issues. In HLD, you also consider stakeholders, deployment, and third-party services.

### Key Aspects of HLD

1. Requirement Analysis
2. System Architecture: Server, client, components, database, etc.
3. Component/Module Design
4. Data Design / Interfaces / API Schema
5. Technology Selection
6. Functional Requirements: Interaction flow
7. Non-Functional Requirements: Performance, responsiveness, accessibility, SEO, offline support, caching, etc.

### Remember in Interviews

- Ask questions
- Don't assumeâ€”always ask for clarifications
- Drive the interview based on the interviewerâ€™s intent
- System design is more than just drawing boxes
- Understand functional vs. non-functional requirements
