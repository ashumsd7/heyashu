### Low-Level Design in Frontend

In React, everything is a component. Even on a web page, whatever we see is an element, and a collection of elements forms a component‚Äîlike an image component or a logo component. A composition of multiple components forms a complete web page. Components are the **building blocks** of a web page.

### Low-Level Design in Frontend

**Front-end low-level design** refers to **the detailed, component-level design process** within a web application's user interface. It focuses on the **specific implementation of individual features** like buttons, forms, or modals, their interactions, rendering patterns, and performance considerations.

So, it‚Äôs all about **how code is written** and **how components are structured**.

If you are asked to design a web page with a **navbar and some cards**, it will look like this:

Code wise it will look like this

```jsx
<AppCOmponent>
  <Header>
     <left>
       <logo>
           <img>
       </logo>
      </left>
      <right>
         <nav elements/>
      </right> 
   <Header/>         
```

### Low-Level Design in Frontend

In an interview, you need to **explain everything clearly** to show that you have proper knowledge of **how to structure and design** an entire web application.

You should be able to **talk about**:

* **Scrollbars** (horizontal, vertical) and how they work.
* **Which libraries** you will use to enhance user experience.
* **How to design platforms** like **YouTube**‚Äîwhere components will be placed, how many components will be there, and how they will interact.

Your code should be:

‚úÖ **Modular**

‚úÖ **Reusable**

‚úÖ **Readable**

‚úÖ **Testable**

‚úÖ **Scalable**

### Design a Sidebar

If an interviewer asks you to **design a sidebar with a toggle state**, you need to **explain**:

* **Where** to place your components.
* **How** to manage state properly.
* **How** to structure the component for efficiency.

### Component Hierarchy

**Before writing code**, focusing on **component hierarchy** is **a must**. It helps in:

‚úÖ **Better structure**

‚úÖ **Easier maintenance**

‚úÖ **Less refactoring in the future**

**Always plan** your components on **digital notes or a notebook** before writing code. This ensures **efficient design** and **scalability** in your project.

### SOLID Principle

**S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

* This applies to **components** as well.
* **A component should have a single responsibility**‚Äîdon't write **500-600 lines of code** in one component.
* If a file is too big, **break it down into smaller reusable components**.

üìå We will discuss **other SOLID principles** later‚Äîstay tuned!

### Higher-Order Components (HOC)

A **Higher-Order Component (HOC)** is a component that **wraps another component** to **add extra features**.

Example:

* Suppose you have a **Card** component.
* You want to **add a "Pro" tag** for premium users.
* Instead of **modifying the existing Card component**, create a new **PromotedCard** component that **wraps** the Card component and adds the "Pro" tag.

‚û°Ô∏è **HOC takes a component as input and returns a new enhanced component.**
