Shimmer UI is **a user interface that uses a moving animation to indicate that a web page or app is loading**. It is used to enhance the user experience by displaying a placeholder similar to the actual content until the real data loads.

That's it. I'm not providing a specific exampleâ€”you are capable enough to understand this and develop it using any library or your own CSS and HTML. Display this component until the `isLoading` value is `true`.
