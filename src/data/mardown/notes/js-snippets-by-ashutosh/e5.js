## About the Creator 
(The Boss, Akshay Saini)

Akshay started building websites in the 7th or 8th grade and has since worked at Paytm, Uber, Lendingkart, and multiple startups, where he learned how to develop large-scale projects. He even started a startup while still in college. Throughout his career, one of the key factors that has helped him succeed is being curious. He believes that having curiosity and the desire to learn new things will help you continually improve. He encourages you to ask questions, as this will significantly benefit your career. Akshay urges you to maintain this curiosity during the course as well.

## Requests from the Creator Before Starting the Course

1. Keep taking notes, either digitally or in a notebook, as you follow along with the videos.
2. Practice the concepts as you watch the videos.
3. You can write notes in Notion, Evernote, or on your personal website (this suggestion is from me, not the creator).
4. Focus during the videos. Silence your phones.
5. Plan and schedule your course, and stick to it.
6. Watch one episode, then take a break. Try to explore the concepts on the internet, implement them on your system, and then move on to the next one.
7. Join the Discord community (the link is available within the course).
8. Ask questions and help each other out.
9. Make friends.
